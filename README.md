## Important Notes:

API Level 26 to 31: This approach effectively creates a custom _splash screen_ for API levels 26 to 31.
API Level 32 and Above: For API level 32 and above, you'll need to handle the system-provided splash screen as described in previous responses. You can make it transparent and then display your custom splash screen activity.
Image Considerations: Choose a lightweight image for your splash screen to avoid delays in loading. Consider using a VectorDrawable for better scalability and performance.
Initialization: In your splash screen activity, perform any necessary initialization tasks (e.g., loading data, checking for updates) before proceeding to your main activity.
This approach provides a consistent splash screen experience across a wide range of Android versions while allowing you to customize the look and feel. Remember to test thoroughly on different devices and API levels to ensure a smooth and optimal user experience.
